Abstract:The  RRT  algorithm  can  deal  with  the  motion  planning  problems  in  consideration  of  non-holonomicdifferential  constraints,  but  it  does  not  taken  into  consideration  the  optimal  path  problem  in  planning  process.Random selection of nodes leads to every planning cost relatively different because of only use of metric function innew node  selection.  In this  paper, an improved  heuristic  RRT-A* algorithm  is proposed  for robot  motion planningwith  non-holonomic  constraints.  In  this  algorithm,  the  cost  function  of  A-Star(A*)  is  introduced  into  the  RRTalgorithm  to  optimize  the  performance.  Meanwhile,  severalmetric  functions  are  used  as  the  heuristic  informationfunctions respectively to measure the performance of different metric function. The simulation results shown that theManhattan  heuristic information  function based RRT-A*planning algorithm  is better  than the other improved  RRTalgorithms in optimization path and computational cost
